# DungeonConnect

DungeonConnect is a Club Enrolment Portal designed specifically for Dungeons & Dragons enthusiasts. 

## Project Overview

DungeonConnect aims to provide a seamless experience for both club administrators and members. The platform allows clubs to register, declare session times, and connect with their members. Users can join clubs, reserve spots in sessions, and initiate conversations with club administrators and other members through a comprehensive messaging feature.

The application is accessible online at [DungeonConnect](https://dungeonconnect-2402b.web.app).
You can either sign in with your Google account or create a new account. When creating a new account, the email address needs to follow the structure of a normal email (e.g., user@example.com), but it does not need to be an actual working email address. There are no restrictions in place to verify the email address for ease of checking out the platform .
